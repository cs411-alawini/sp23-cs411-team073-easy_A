## Project Summary

The project aims to allow the users to view the flights for their travel based on the airline performance with respect to delays. While it will also allow users to look at flights based on their preferred departure/arrival time, the tool will have an additional functionality to let the users know the probability of their flights getting delayed based on the history of the flight performance. The tool will also allow only the authorized users (in our tool UIUC staff and students) to modify the existing data when there are changes like addition of new airports and flights, update in the flight schedule or status, bankruptcy of an airline etc.
